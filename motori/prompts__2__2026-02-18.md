MASTER PROMPT - SCENE 3/95
DURATION: 6 seconds
========================================

Photorealistic 40-year-old man with shifting alarmed expression, casual shirt, watching sky rapidly darkening through car windshield as violent downpour hammers the glass, medium shot at eye level from inside car, car interior with sheets of water obscuring windshield view, dramatic weather shift atmosphere with desaturated grey and dark blue-black color palette, clear Italian narrative voiceover and intensifying rain sounds.

Audio: Italian dialogue native speaker.
Voiceover: "diventa grigio, poi nero. E zac. Parte il diluvio universale. Un casino d'acqua"
Speech style: narrative storytelling urgent dramatic moderate intensity male.

0-3s Medium shot smooth push-in realistic pacing: windshield view shows sky shifting rapidly from light blue to grey to black clouds in swift dramatic sequence, first scattered raindrops hit glass immediately and multiply fast, man's relaxed expression shifts sharply to concern

3-6s Medium shot static locked realistic pacing: sudden heavy downpour hammers car roof and windshield forcefully, water sheets across glass obscuring vision rapidly, man sits up straight swiftly gripping steering wheel tighter with both hands, head leans slightly forward in response to storm

Visual style: photorealistic cinematic documentary aesthetic with realistic textures, dramatic transition from warm blue palette to cold dark grey-black conveying sudden threat and loss of control.
Physics & Motion: realistic motion physics with emphasis on rapid weather change and heavy water impact effects on glass.
Camera control: Single smooth push-in movement from 0s to 3s to intensify dramatic sky transition, then camera locks static from 3s to 6s.
Audio mix: Italian voiceover is main foreground element clearly audible above all, rain sound builds rapidly from scattered drops to full downpour at moderate-to-loud volume clearly audible, car interior ambient hum in deep background at low volume, no music.
Pacing: Realistic speed throughout scene with high-energy dynamic tempo escalating rapidly to match sudden storm intensity.
